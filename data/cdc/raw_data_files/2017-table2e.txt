Notes:

	These are annual cases of selected infectious 
	national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). 
	NNDSS data reported by the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories are 
	collated and published. Cases are reported by state health departments to CDC weekly. Because source datasets 
	may be updated as additional information is received, statistics in publications based on that source data may 
	differ from what is presented in these tables. 

	The list of nationally notifiable infectious diseases and conditions for 2018 and their national surveillance case definitions are 
	available by navigating to the https://ndc.services.cdc.gov/, Surveillance Case Definitions | CDC  web page, selecting 
	"2017" for the notifiable condition list year, checking "infectious" conditions, and clicking "Get Notifiable List by Year".  
	This list incorporates the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) position statements approved in 2016 by CSTE 
	for national surveillance, that were implemented in January 2017, including updated surveillance case definitions for 
	salmonellosis, shigellosis, vibrioisis, perinatal hepatitis B virus infection, invasive pneumococcal disease, Lyme disease, 
	and tularemia reported through August 7, 2018. Publication criteria for the finalized 2017 data are available at 
	https://wonder.cdc.gov/nndss/documents/2017_NNDSS_Publication_Criteria.pdf, https://wonder.cdc.gov/nndss/documents/2017_NNDSS_Publication_Criteria.pdf.   
	See also https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf, 
	Guide to Interpreting Provisional and Finalized NNDSS Data. 

	Population estimates for incidence rates are July 1st, 2017 estimates obtained from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) 
	postcensal estimates of the resident population of the United States for April 1, 2010 - July 1, 2017, by year, county, single year 
	of age (range: 0 to 85 years), bridged-race (white, black or African American, American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, 
	or Pacific Islander), Hispanic ethnicity (not Hispanic or Latino, Hispanic or Latino), and sex (Vintage 2017), 
	prepared under a collaborative arrangement with the U.S. Census Bureau. Population estimates for states released 
	June 27, 2018 are available at 
	https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/bridged_race/data_documentation.htm, https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/bridged_race/data_documentation.htm. 
	Population estimates for territories are the 2017 mid-year estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau International Data Base, accessed on 
	October 2, 2018 at  
	https://www.census.gov/data-tools/demo/idb/informationGateway.php, https://www.census.gov/data-tools/demo/idb/informationGateway.php. 
	The choice of population denominators 
	for incidence is based on the availability of population data at the time of publication preparation. 

	Annual tables for 2016 and later years are available on https://wonder.cdc.gov/nndss/nndss_annual_tables_menu.asp, CDC WONDER.

	Annual summary reports from 1993-2015 are available as published in the 
	https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/mmwr_nd/index.html, MMWR.

	NNDSS annual tables since 1952 are available at https://stacks.cdc.gov/nndss, CDC Stacks
