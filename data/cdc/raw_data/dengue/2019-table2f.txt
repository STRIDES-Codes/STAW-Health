—: No reported cases - The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.
N: Not reportable - The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.
U: Unavailable - The data are unavailable.

* The 2019 annual tables exclude cases of nationally notifiable conditions and diseases among non-U.S. residents. As a result, data in Table 2 does not include a "Non-U.S. Resident" or "Total" row, that would have been included in the table had the data been stratified into the following four categories, based upon the "country of usual residence" (COUR) algorithm: U.S. Residents, excluding U.S. Territories; U.S. Territories; Non-US. Residents; and Total.Table 2 for the 2019 annual tables only includes the first two of these stratification categories. 

† To calculate rates, use the populations provided in Table 8. Note that calculation of rates for the following conditions use population subsets presented in Table 8: Zika virus infection, congenital; Zika virus disease, congenital; Infant botulism; Congenital rubella syndrome; Perinatal Hepatitis B infection, Perinatal Hepatitis C infection,  Haemophilus influenzae, invasive disease and Invasive pneumococcal disease, and Influenza associated pediatric mortality; see Table 8 (population reference table). Also see notes 3 and 7.

§ Counts include confirmed and probable dengue cases.


Notes:

	These are annual cases of selected infectious 
	national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). 
	NNDSS data reported by the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories are 
	collated and published. Cases are reported by state health departments to CDC weekly. Because source datasets 
	may be updated as additional information is received, statistics in publications based on that source data may 
	differ from what is presented in these tables. 

	The list of national notifiable infectious diseases and conditions for 2019 and their national surveillance case definitions are 
	available by navigating to the https://ndc.services.cdc.gov/, Surveillance Case Definitions | CDC  web page, selecting 
	"2019" for the notifiable condition list year, checking "infectious" conditions, and clicking "Get Notifiable List by Year".
  This list incorporates the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) position statements approved in 2018 by CSTE for 
  national surveillance that were implemented in January 2019.  Candida auris, clinical became a new national notifiable condition,
  and revised case definitions were implemented for the following conditions: diphtheria, acute hepatitis A, listeriosis, yellow fever, 
  Salmonella Paratyphi infection and Salmonella Typhi infection. Salmonella Paratyphi infection 
  and Salmonella Typhi infection replaced Paratyphoid fever and Typhoid fever, respectively, as national notifiable 
  conditions. Salmonellosis (excluding S. Typhi infection and S. Paratyphi infection) replaced Salmonellosis (excluding paratyphoid fever and typhoid fever) as a national notifiable condition. 
  In addition, Carbapenemase Producing Carbapenem-Resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CP-CRE) represents a consolidation of CP-CRE species 
   Klebsiella spp, CP-CRE E. coli, and CP-CRE Enterobacter spp.  Publication criteria for the finalized 2019 data are available at 
	https://wonder.cdc.gov/nndss/documents/2019_NNDSS _Publication_Criteria_01212021.pdf, https://wonder.cdc.gov/nndss/documents/2019_NNDSS _Publication_Criteria_01212021.pdf.

	Guide to Interpreting Provisional and Finalized NNDSS Data. 
	Population estimates for incidence rates are July 1st, 2019, estimates obtained from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) 
	postcensal estimates of the resident population of the United States for April 1, 2010, to July 1, 2019, by year, county, single year 
	of age (range: 0 to 85 years), bridged-race (white, black or African American, American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, 
	or Pacific Islander), Hispanic ethnicity (not Hispanic or Latino, Hispanic or Latino), and sex (Vintage 2019), 
	prepared under a collaborative arrangement with the U.S. Census Bureau. Population estimates for states released 
	July 9, 2020, are available at 
	https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/bridged_race/data_documentation.htm, https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/bridged_race/data_documentation.htm. 
	Population estimates for territories are the 2019 mid-year estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau International Data Base, accessed on 
	August 6, 2020, at  
	https://www.census.gov/data-tools/demo/idb/#/country?YR_ANIM=2021, https://www.census.gov/data-tools/demo/idb/#/country?YR_ANIM=2021. 
	The choice of population denominators for incidence is based on the availability of population data at the time of publication preparation. 

	Annual tables for 2016 and later years are available on https://wonder.cdc.gov/nndss/nndss_annual_tables_menu.asp, CDC WONDER.

	Annual summary reports from 1993&#8211;2015 are available as published in the 
	https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/mmwr_nd/index.html, Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.

	NNDSS annual tables since 1952 are available at https://stacks.cdc.gov/nndss, CDC Stacks
	(once in CDC Stacks, select "Annual Reports" in the "Genre" box to the left).  

	For most conditions, national incidence rates are calculated as the number of reported cases for each infectious 
	disease or condition divided by the U.S. resident population for the specified demographic population or the total U.S. 
	resident population, multiplied by 100,000. When a national notifiable infectious condition is associated with a 
	specific age restriction, the same restriction was applied to the population in the denominator of the incidence rate 
	calculation. In addition, population data from reporting jurisdictions in which the disease or condition was not reportable 
	or not available were excluded from the denominator of the incidence rate calculations.
	
		Age restrictions in the numerator and denominator are applied for the following childhood conditions:
		
		
			Zika virus disease, congenital (age restriction in numerator and denominator is <1 year)
		
			Zika virus infection, congenital (age restriction in numerator and denominator is <1 year)
		
			Haemophilus influenzae, invasive disease <5 years (age restriction in numerator and denominator is <5 years) 
		
			Invasive pneumococcal disease <5 years (age restriction in numerator and denominator is <5 years) 
		
			Influenza associated pediatric mortality (age restriction in numerator and denominator is <18 years)
		
			Infant botulism (age restriction in numerator and denominator is <1 year) 
		
			Congenital rubella syndrome (age restriction in numerator and denominator is  <1 year)
		
			Perinatal Hepatitis B infection (age restriction in numerator is &le;24 months, denominator is <24 months) 
		
			Perinatal Hepatitis C infection (age restriction in numerator is &le;36 months, denominator is <36 months). 
		
	
	
			
			Data for congenital syphilis are aggregated by the infant's year of birth.  The rate for congenital syphilis is based upon the 
			number of reported cases per 100,000 live births, using  natality data for 2019 (National Center for Health Statistics https://wonder.cdc.gov/natality.html, Natality 2019, as compiled from data
			provided by the Vital Statistics Cooperative Program).  
			The mother's race and ethnicity are used for race- and ethnicity-specific rates of congenital syphilis cases.  Congenital syphilis 
			data are published in Syphilis Statistics in the sexually transmitted diseases (STD) surveillance 
			report (https://www.cdc.gov/std/syphilis/stats.htm, https://www.cdc.gov/std/syphilis/stats.htm) and in the historical archives of the STD surveillance 
			report (https://www.cdc.gov/std/stats/archive.htm, https://www.cdc.gov/std/stats/archive.htm). The STD surveillance 
			report (https://www.cdc.gov/std/syphilis/stats.htm, https://www.cdc.gov/std/syphilis/stats.htm) updates congenital syphilis cases and rates over time.    
			

	Surveillance data reported by other CDC programs might vary from data reported in these tables because of differences in
	 1) the date used to aggregate the data, 2) the timing of reports, 3) the source of the data, 4) surveillance case definitions, 
	 and 5) policies regarding case jurisdiction (i.e., which jurisdiction should submit the case notification to CDC).
	


	The following 24 jurisdictions may have incomplete data, due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic:  Alaska, California, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia,
	Florida, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New York 
  (excluding New York City), New York City, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas,  and West Virginia. 
	In addition, the following 2 U.S. Territories may have incomplete data due to the COVID-19 pandemic: American Samoa and the 
	U.S. Virgin Islands.
