Notes:

	These are annual cases of selected infectious 
	national notifiable diseases from the 
	National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS).  
	NNDSS data reported by the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia, 
	and the U.S. territories are collated and published. 
	Cases are reported by state health departments to CDC weekly.  
	Because source datasets may be updated as additional information is received, statistics in publications 
	based on that source data may differ from what is presented in these tables. 

	The list of nationally notifiable infectious diseases and conditions for 2016 and their national surveillance case definitions are 
	available by navigating to the https://ndc.services.cdc.gov/, Surveillance Case Definitions | CDC  web page, selecting 
	"2016" for the notifiable condition list year, checking "infectious" conditions, and clicking "Get Notifiable List by Year".
	This list incorporates the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) position 
	statements approved in 2015 by CSTE for national surveillance, that were implemented in 
	January 2016, including updated surveillance case definitions for acute hepatitis C and chronic 
	hepatitis C virus infections.  2016 data are reported through June 30, 2017.  
	Publication criteria for the finalized 2016 data are available at https://wonder.cdc.gov/nndss/documents/2016_NNDSS_Publication_Criteria.pdf, /nndss/documents/2016_NNDSS_Publication_Criteria.pdf.
	See also https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf, 
	Guide to Interpreting Provisional and Finalized NNDSS Data. 


	Population estimates for incidence rates are July 1st, 2016 estimates
	obtained from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) 
	postcensal estimates of the resident population of the United States for July 1, 2011 - July 1, 2016, 
	by year, county, single year of age (range: 0 to 85 years), bridged-race 
	(white, black or African American, American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, or Pacific Islander), 
	Hispanic ethnicity (not Hispanic or Latino, Hispanic or Latino),  and sex 
	(Vintage 2016), prepared under a collaborative arrangement with the U.S. Census Bureau.
	Population estimates for states as of June 26, 2017 are available at 
	 https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/bridged_race/data_documentation.htm, https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/bridged_race/data_documentation.htm.  
	 Population estimates for territories are the 2016 mid-year estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau 
	 International Data Base accessed on July 24, 2017 at 
	 https://www.census.gov/population/international/data/idb/informationGateway.php, https://www.census.gov/population/international/data/idb/informationGateway.php. 
	 The choice of population denominators for incidence is based on the availability of population 
	 data at the time of publication preparation.  

	Annual tables for 2016 and later years are available on https://wonder.cdc.gov/nndss/nndss_annual_tables_menu.asp, CDC WONDER.

	Annual summary reports from 1993-2015 are available as published in the 
	https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/mmwr_nd/index.html, MMWR.

	NNDSS annual tables since 1952 are available at https://stacks.cdc.gov/nndss, CDC Stacks
